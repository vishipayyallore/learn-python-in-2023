## Few Points to Remember

> 1. Python is a case sensitive language.
> 1. All Entities in Python are objects. String, List, Tuple, Dictionary, Set, etc. are all objects. Even Functions are objects.
> 1. Object is an instance of a class. Class is a blueprint of an object.

## Functions

```python
# Snake case is used for function names
def my_function(param1, param2):
  print("Hello from a function")
  return param1 + param2

# Calling a function
my_function(1, 2)
```
